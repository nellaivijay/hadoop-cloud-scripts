# Deprecated

This project is deprecated. For reference you can check the `depricated` branch ... - though you can always use this shell script to provision Hadoop / HDP with Ambari on the cloud (AWS), we are no longer maintaining / supporting this (we switched to Ansible).

For an easier way to provison Hadoop in the cloud you should check our [Cloudbreak](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/) project. For a quick try you can use our hosted / free Cloudbreak instance : https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/
